**Slide Title: Terraform Overview**

---

**What is Terraform?**
- Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp.
- It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

---

**Usage of Terraform:**
- Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform is used to automate the provisioning of infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networks, and storage.
- Multi-Cloud Deployment: It supports provisioning infrastructure across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
- Configuration Management: Terraform enables configuration management by defining infrastructure as code, making it easy to version control and maintain.
