Subject: Inquiry Regarding XSD Schema Changes in TBF Server

Hi Steve,

I hope this message finds you well. We've been conducting regular checks on the XSD schema changes in our development environment, specifically by referencing the paths on the TBF server:

- my_path/path1
- my_path/path2

However, it has come to our attention that no new XSD files have been received since October 2023. We're wondering if there have been any modifications on the TBF server following the upgrade to TBF2 that might be causing this issue.

Could you please confirm if there have been changes to the server paths? If so, we would appreciate it if you could provide the updated paths so that we can reconfigure our system accordingly for our schema checks.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
