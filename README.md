It seems like there's an issue with missing dependencies related to the XML data source in PySpark. You can try adding the necessary package explicitly by including it in your Databricks notebook or script.

Before reading XML files, add the following line to include the necessary package:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.jars.packages", "com.databricks:spark-xml_2.12:0.13.0")
```

This line specifies the XML data source package version compatible with your Spark version.

Here's the modified code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import bz2

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("XMLMerge").getOrCreate()

# Add XML data source package
spark.conf.set("spark.jars.packages", "com.databricks:spark-xml_2.12:0.13.0")

# Specify your S3 paths
input_path = "s3://your-input-path/*.xml"
output_path = "s3://your-output-path/merged.xml.bz2"

# Read XML files into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.format("xml").option("rowTag", "your_row_tag").load(input_path)

# Convert DataFrame to XML string
xml_string = df.toXML()

# Write the XML string to a bz2-compressed file on S3
with bz2.BZ2File(output_path, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(xml_string.encode())

# Stop Spark session
spark.stop()
```

Remember to replace `"your-input-path/*.xml"` and `"your-output-path/merged.xml.bz2"` with your actual S3 paths. This should resolve the issue related to the missing XML data source.
