We've re-executed the table DDL for t_tbl in the development environment. Can you please rerun Job 1 locally to ensure it runs smoothly?

Additionally, we're encountering a similar issue with t_tbl1. Kindly run Job 2 for t_tbl1 and confirm its successful execution.

Attached are the parquet file and DDL required for Job 2.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
