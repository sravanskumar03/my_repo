Certainly! You can achieve this by using PySpark in Databricks. Here's a high-level example of how you could approach this:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET
import bz2

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MergeXML").getOrCreate()

# Specify your S3 input and output paths
input_path = "s3://your-input-path/*.xml"
output_path = "s3://your-output-path/single.xml.bz2"

# Read XML files into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.format("xml").option("rowTag", "yourRowTag").load(input_path)

# Convert DataFrame to XML string
xml_string = df.selectExpr("to_xml_string(struct(*)) as xml").collect()[0].xml

# Write XML string to a temporary local file
with open("/tmp/temp.xml", "w") as temp_file:
    temp_file.write(xml_string)

# Compress the temporary file using bz2
with open("/tmp/temp.xml", "rb") as source, bz2.BZ2File("/tmp/temp.xml.bz2", "wb") as dest:
    dest.writelines(source)

# Upload the compressed file to S3
spark.sparkContext.addFile("file:/tmp/temp.xml.bz2")
spark.read.text("file:/tmp/temp.xml.bz2").write.text(output_path, compression="bzip2", mode="overwrite")

# Clean up temporary files
spark.sparkContext.clearFiles()
```

Make sure to replace `"your-input-path"`, `"your-output-path"`, and `"yourRowTag"` with your actual S3 paths and the appropriate XML row tag. This script reads all XML files into a PySpark DataFrame, converts it to a single XML string, writes it to a temporary file, compresses the file using bz2, and then uploads it to the specified S3 output path. Finally, it cleans up the temporary files.

Note: Ensure that your Databricks cluster has the necessary permissions to read from the input S3 path and write to the output S3 path. Adjust the script according to your XML structure and requirements.
