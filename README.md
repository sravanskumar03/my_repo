Here is an example of how you can use a loop to call a function that returns a list containing the name and age of a person, and use the results to create a DataFrame in PySpark:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

def calculate_age(name, dob):
    # Your code to calculate the age based on the given dob
    age = 25 # Example age
    return [name, age]

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Create DataFrame").getOrCreate()

people = [("Alice", "1996-01-01"), ("Bob", "1995-01-01")]
data = [calculate_age(name, dob) for name, dob in people]
schema = StructType([StructField("name", StringType(), True), StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)])
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)
df.show()
```

In this example, we define a function `calculate_age` that takes as input the name and date of birth of a person and returns a list containing the name and calculated age. We then use a list comprehension and a loop to call this function for each person in the `people` list and use the resulting lists to create a DataFrame in PySpark.

Make sure to replace the example code in the `calculate_age` function with your own code for calculating the age based on the given date of birth.

Is there anything else you need help with?
