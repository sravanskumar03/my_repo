Here is an example of how to write a JSON object containing 5 S3 paths to a file, read the file, and convert the JSON object into a list of S3 paths using PySpark and the `json` module in Databricks:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import json

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Read JSON").getOrCreate()

# Write JSON data to a file
data = {
    "s3_paths": [
        "s3://my-bucket/path1",
        "s3://my-bucket/path2",
        "s3://my-bucket/path3",
        "s3://my-bucket/path4",
        "s3://my-bucket/path5"
    ]
}

with open("/tmp/data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# Read JSON data from the file
with open("/tmp/data.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Convert JSON data into a list of S3 paths
s3_paths = data["s3_paths"]

print(s3_paths)
```

This code writes a JSON object containing 5 S3 paths to a file using the `json.dump()` method. Then, it reads the JSON data from the file using the `json.load()` method and converts it into a Python dictionary. Finally, it extracts the list of S3 paths from the dictionary. Is this what you were looking for?
