What is snowflake in data engineering field 

In the data engineering field, Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that provides a fully-managed, scalable, and secure solution for storing and analyzing large amounts of data. Snowflake's architecture is designed to separate storage and compute, allowing users to easily scale their data storage and processing power independently.

Snowflake uses a unique architecture called the Multi-Cluster Shared Data Architecture, which allows users to easily share data between multiple compute clusters and manage their data storage and processing in a centralized way. Snowflake also provides native support for popular data integration and visualization tools, making it a popular choice for organizations that need to analyze large amounts of data.
