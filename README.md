Here's an updated version of the code that reads data from a table using a predefined SELECT query stored in a string:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from datetime import datetime
import concurrent.futures

def process_data(import_date):
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ProcessData").getOrCreate()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM your_table_name WHERE import_date = '{import_date}'"
    df = spark.sql(query)
    df.write.parquet(f"s3://your_bucket/your_prefix/{import_date}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_year = 2019
    current_year = datetime.now().year
    years = [str(year) for year in range(start_year, current_year + 1)]
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(process_data, years)
```

This code creates a SELECT query string that filters the data based on the `import_date` parameter. The `spark.sql` method is then used to execute the query and create a DataFrame from the result. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

Is there anything else you would like me to help with?
