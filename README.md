Here is an example of how you can read a .txt file stored in an S3 path and create a list with the data in the .txt file using PySpark in Databricks without using `sc.addFile`:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Replace with your S3 path to the .txt file
s3_path = "s3a://your-bucket/your-file.txt"

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ReadS3File").getOrCreate()

# Read the .txt file as a DataFrame
df = spark.read.text(s3_path)

# Collect the data from the DataFrame and create a list
data = [row.value for row in df.collect()]

# Now you have a list of the data in the .txt file
print(data)
```

Make sure to replace `s3a://your-bucket/your-file.txt` with your actual S3 path to the .txt file. Does this help?
