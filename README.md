Here is an example of how you can read a .txt file containing 5 S3 paths from an S3 path and create a list of the given 5 S3 paths in the txt file using PySpark in Databricks:

```python
from pyspark import SparkFiles

# Replace with your S3 path to the .txt file
s3_path = "s3a://your-bucket/your-file.txt"

# Add the .txt file to Spark context
sc.addFile(s3_path)

# Read the .txt file and create a list of S3 paths
with open(SparkFiles.get("your-file.txt")) as f:
    s3_paths = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]

# Now you have a list of S3 paths
print(s3_paths)
```

Make sure to replace `s3a://your-bucket/your-file.txt` with your actual S3 path to the .txt file and `your-file.txt` with the name of your .txt file. Does this help?
