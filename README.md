Here's a professional and polite rewrite of your email message:

Hi xx,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that we have rerun the count comparison query with the updated list of RU codes and have uploaded the excel sheet to the sharepoint.

Additionally, we have included a view that shows the sum of submission statuses for the entire submissions on Pre issuance and BIRM, along with the queries used.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
